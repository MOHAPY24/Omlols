## 🚀 **What is Omlols?**

**Omlols** — short for **OhMyLlamaOnLifeSupport** — is a lightweight, customizable Python client designed to interact with **Ollama** in a clean, modular, and prompt-engineer-friendly way.

This project is built for personal use, but it's structured well enough for others to extend, study, or borrow ideas from. The main goal is to:

* Create a **clean interactive interface** for Ollama
* Allow **deep prompt control** and **prompt-engineering experiments**
* Provide **modularity** for plugins, memory, and external text sources
* Keep everything simple, readable, and easy to modify

If you're into tinkering with LLM clients, RAG experiments, or custom workflows—Omills is for you.
